from ase import Atom

a = Atom('O',[5,6,6])
# as far a I know, the O is the element 
#and [1,1,1]is the position

print a.position

# change atom type
a.symbol = 'Au'
print a.symbol
print a.mass
# I can change the type of atom by a.number = 1 or a.symbol = 'H'
# after that, the mass, number and anything is reversed based on element you chooose
